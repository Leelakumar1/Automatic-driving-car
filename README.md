# Automatic-driving-car

* Designed and implemented a 2D game utilizing the Pygame library, which showcases an autonomous vehicle navigating a
  dynamic track
• The project involved initializing the game environment, integrating custom track and vehicle graphics, and orchestrating
  a sophisticated decision-making mechanism for the car’s movement
• The car’s trajectory is intelligently guided by the analysis of pixel data from the track’s surface, enabling it to make
  informed turns and advance along the track
• The game maintains a consistent 60 frames-per-second performance, delivering a polished and interactive user experience,
  thereby demonstrating proficiency in game development and algorithmic problem-solving
